# FRONTUP

## What is Frontup?

Is a quick way to setup a modular css project.

It's based on COMPASS and you can find either SASS or SCSS version as you prefer.

### CONFIG

You need to edit the config.rb file to decide if you want to use the SCSS or SASS version.
You can delete the other one to avoid useless files


### COMPILING

If you don't want to use "compass watch", you can use stardar sass init

 cd frontup
 sass -C -t compact -g --watch ./sass/:./css


### PROMISE

I'll write something more, promise! If you need any help to understand the structure, contact me directly
