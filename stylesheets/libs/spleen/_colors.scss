// define here your colors' palette
// variables are defined with a "c" prefix to better understand that you refer to a color var
// I usualy use variables to define colors and then other variable for the section I want
// to be colored with. Even if it could sounds like a repetition, i think its
// That's a good compromise to change colors to section without compromise other things
